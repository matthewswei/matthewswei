## 👋 Welcome!
---

I am an engineer just doing my thing. I went to school at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and graduated there with Bachelor's in Science majoring in Electrical Enineering with two minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. Interested in both hardware and software, so things like embedded systems really get me going 😜.<br><br>
I plan on adding any personal projects I do throughout the years here but right now, the repo is full of projects and assignments from my coursework during university.<br><br>Enjoy your visit!

## 💡 Interests
---

#### ⚡️ Circuit Design
- Haven't taken any advanced circuit design classes. I do hope to one day get a masters degree and take some of these classes though.
- Experience in both schematic design and PCB layout through various classes and projects I have done throughout the years
- On an IC level, have been inside a clean room and fabricated a 4-inch wafer consisting of many common semiconductor devices
- Did circuit design during my intership at Microsoft for the Surface Laptop

#### 📲 Embedded Systems
- Out of all my classes, I personally found the ones most interesting and fun were all related to embedded systems (microcontrollers  or FPGAs)
- When I do my masters, I plan to specialize in embedded systems programming (I love both hardware and software and this seems like the best of both worlds)
- Have coded a Linux-like operating system from scratch as well as device drivers and experience in common communication protocols

#### 💻 Computer Architecture
- Basic knowledge and exposure to CPU architecture as well as GPU architecture
- I find it interesting how a CPU works at a low-level, not much interest in pursuing it as a job though
- Modeled a 16-bit processor ISA and instruction cycle in SystemVerilog
- Plan on one day coding through simulation and modeling a basic processor as a personal project
