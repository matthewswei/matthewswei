- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @matthewswei!
- I'm currently an undergrad student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.
- Some coding langauges I have dabbled in are Java, Python, C, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. I am not proficient in any yet and am a novice in pretty much all of them.
- This GitHub is going to be used as more of a way for me to store my code that I develop throughout my college experience.
-Enjoy your stay!
